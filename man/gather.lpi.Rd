\title{Gather LPI data into tall/long data frames}
\usage{
\method{gather}{lpi}(dima.tables, meta = TRUE,
  species.characteristics = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dima.tables}{A list of data frames. Recommended to use the output from\code{read.dima()}. Must contain data frames called tblLPIHeader and tblLPIDetail which have the same fields as the tables in DIMA with the same names. If \code{meta} is \code{TRUE} then it must also include data frames called tblSites, tblPlots, and tblLines which have the same fields as the tables in DIMA with the same names. If \code{species.characteristics} is \code{TRUE} then it must also include data frames called tblSpecies and tblSpeciesGrowthHabit (and optionally tblSpeciesGroups) which have the same fields as the tables in DIMA with the same names.}

\item{meta}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} then the site, plot, and line names and keys will be added to the output data frames from \code{dima.list} using the data frames called tblSites, tblPlots, and tblLines. Defaults to \code{TRUE}}

\item{species.characteristics}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} then the available species information will be added from \code{dima.list} using the data frames tblSpecies, tblSpeciesGrowthHabit, and, if available, tblSpeciesGroups. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list of two data frames: one containing the data from the LPI pin intercepts and one containing the data from the height methd done alongside pin drops.
}
\description{
Given a list of data frames containing tblSites, tblPlots, tblLines, tblLPIHeader, and tblLPIDetail, create a tall format data frame for canopy data from LPI and one for heights from the specialized height fields.
